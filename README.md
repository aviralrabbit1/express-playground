# express-playground

### Initialise Project 
```
npm init -y
```

### Install **`express`** 
```
npm install express
```

### Install **`nodemon`** 
#### (as devDependency, needed while/for development, but not for running the project) with 
```
npm install nodemon --save-dev
```

### Middelware
```
app.use(funcition, (req, res, next) => {

})
```
Middelware endpoint will use app.METHOD(req, res)

### Controller module
- one for each collection of data (friends and messages)

### Models
- To access the data from anywhere(controllers and/or view)

### Express Router
- we can mount a group of path under a specific route

### REST 
`RE`presentational `S`tate `T`ransfer
- **`RE & S:`** how the server makes data available
- **`T:`** how its sent back to user

### RESTful APIs
- Use existing standards(HTTP, JSON, URL)
- Http Endpoints represent collection of data on server side
- Use GET, PUT, POST, DELETE http methods performed on the data
- **Client and server architecture**
    - **`Stateless:`** 
        - Each request is separate to any state on client not included in request
        - Only keep track of data in our collection and not at any session independent of state of client
        - it's opposite will be an API which tracks user data in a session from requests to the server. Eg. session variable in PHP. Not wanted in restful APIs.
    - **`Cacheable:`**
        - We can cache our request because they keep track of our state, saving results for future use
        - minimize work needed to do and increase performance

### HTTP Methods for RESTful Services

|HTTP Verb|CRUD|Entire Collection (e.g. /customers)|Specific Item (e.g. /customers/{id})|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|POST|Create|201 (Created), 'Location' header with link to /customers/{id} containing new ID.|404 (Not Found), 409 (Conflict) if resource already exists..|
|GET|Read|200 (OK), list of customers. Use pagination, sorting and filtering to navigate big lists.|200 (OK), single customer. 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.|
|PUT|Update/Replace|405 (Method Not Allowed), unless you want to update/replace every resource in the entire collection.|200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.|
|PATCH|Update/Modify|405 (Method Not Allowed), unless you want to modify the collection itself.|200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.|
|DELETE|Delete|405 (Method Not Allowed), unless you want to delete the whole collectionâ€”not often desirable.|200 (OK). 404 (Not Found), if ID not found or invalid.|
